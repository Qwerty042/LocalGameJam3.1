Control rod simulation
- control rod/graphite tip/water can either completely or partialy fill a cell, changing its absorbtion and moderation.
- control rods consist of 5-cell long boron, with a 1-unit gap, followed by a 3 unit long graphite 'tip'. once fully withdrawn, the graphite 'tip' fills the center 3 cells of the reactor

Neutron simulation (instant, only dependant on values at current time):
1. Emitted proportional to reaction speed
2. Moderated proportional to moderation of cell(converts fast -> slow)
3. Absorbed proportional to non-reactive and reactive absorbtion (strong effect on slow, weak effect on fast)
4. Unabsorbed neutron flux (fast/slow) travels to adjacent cells evenly (and again moderated and absorbed)
5. Reactive absorbtion feeds back to reaction speed(fast decay effects only next time step, slow works over time)

Moderation simulation
- Whether cell has water, control rod, steam(empty), or graphite tip effects moderation

Absorbtion simulation
- Whether cell has water, control rod, steam(empty), graphite tip, or xenon poisioning effects non-reactive absorbtion
- Temperature effects reactive absorbtion

Temperature simulation
- Reaction speed increased temperature
- Temperature transfered to water and adjacent cells depending on thermal conductivity and temp difference

Xenon simulation
- Reactivity creates pre-xenon products over time
- Pre-xenon products exibit first-order decay to Xenon
- Xenon exibits first order slow natural decay, and first order fast decay based on nuetron flux

Prompt/slow deccay simulation
- Each time step reactivity creates prompt neutrons, and decay products
- Decay products exhibit first order decay over time and release delayed neutrons

Reactor power
- Nuetron flux measured at a number of cells will be used to estimate average reactor power

Reactor water simulation
- Flow speed based on inlet pressure and resistance
- Water enters bottom cell at inlet temp, and moves upwards in columns from cell-to-cell based on flow speed/resistance
- If water gets too hot (dependant on pressure and temp) it will boil
- Steam increases flow resistance, and effects moderation/absorbtion


Core simulation order:
- neutron emission from reactivity
	-








Inlet temp
- Based on temp in steam seperator

Outlet temp
- Based on weighted average of temperature after water travels through reactor

Steam seperator simluation
- Water enters steam seperator and pressure drops
- Temperature and pressure in seperator lead to boiling, effecting pressure and temperature(endothermic)
- Boiling sends steam to turbine
- Water returns from turbine at ~100C

Turbine power
- Steam enters turbine and turbine power exhibits fast first order response to steam flow
- Turbine speed can go from 0 to operating speed. No power is generated below operating speed, so turbine must be spun up before operation
- Steam condenses after turbine and returns at ~100C
